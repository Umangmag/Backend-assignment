This is the backend for a React-based e-commerce store that manages comic books as inventory items. 
The backend is built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, providing full CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for comic book management.

**Technologies needs to be used**

Node.js: Server-side JavaScript runtime
Express.js: Web framework for Node.js
MongoDB: NoSQL database to store comic details
Mongoose: MongoDB ORM
Postman: Used for API testing
Git: Version control


**Features in my project**

Add new comic books to the inventory with details like name, author, price, etc.
Retrieve all comic books or specific ones by ID, with options for pagination, filtering, and sorting.
Update details of existing comic books.
Delete comic books from the inventory.

**Setup to run**

1. First, clone the repository to your local machine
2. Run "npm install" to install all the necessary dependencies
3. Make your MongoDB running locally or using MongoDB Atlas.
4. Once MongoDB is ready, start the backend server using node server.js
5. The API will be available at http://localhost:5000.
6. we can use Postman to test the API.
